## ðŸš€ Running the Application

### Option 1: Run Locally Without Docker

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PawelDemichowicz/car-dealership.git
   cd car-dealership
   ```

2. **Configure the database**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database manually.
   - Add a `.env` file in the root directory with:
     ```
     DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_db
     DB_USERNAME=your_user
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password
     ```

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

---

### Option 2: Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

> Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PawelDemichowicz/car-dealership.git
   cd car-dealership
   ```

2. **Configure the database**
   - Add a `.env` file in the root directory with:
     ```
     DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_db
     DB_USERNAME=your_user
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password
     ```


3. **Start containers**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8190` (or as defined in `docker-compose.yml`)


5. **To stop and clean up containers**
   ```bash
   docker compose down -v
   ```

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

> Integration tests use **Testcontainers**, so Docker must be running.

Run all tests:
```bash
./gradlew test
```
